def extract_chunks(data: str) -> List[Document]:
    """
    Extracts chunks from input text data using recursive character splitting.

    This function takes a string input and splits it into smaller chunks while maintaining context.
    The chunks are created using a recursive character splitter that:
    - Creates chunks of approximately 200 characters
    - Maintains a 10 character overlap between chunks to preserve context
    - Splits on natural boundaries like paragraphs and sentences when possible

    Args:
        data (str): The input text to be split into chunks

    Returns:
        List[Document]: A list of Document objects, where each Document contains a chunk of the original text
